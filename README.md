# COVID-19 Open Data Analysis

## Objective

This project aims to analyse several aspects of the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus) using publicly available datasets.
This project will primarily be performed using python and .csv flat-files.

We will use trends in infections to map patterns with the intention of building a prediction model.

A stretch objective will be to examine the molecular information and structure of COVID-19 and its variants.
